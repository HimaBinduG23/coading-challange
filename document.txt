We will write a function names as apartmentHunting with two parametarised arguments of blocks and reqs
and we will declare two variables i.e scores and distance with let keyword and
we will create a Loop to calculate how many requirements are fulfilled in different blocks and add the number in scores array
we use maxelement for checking the maximum element in the scores array and we use numberofmaxelement 
Variable to check how many number of maximum elements exist in the scores array
 Loop to find the block which has the greatest number of element in scores array
 Loop to find the block which has the greatest number of element in scores array
Condition to check if distance is negative and replace it with its absolute value
Loop to check the least distance of optimum block
